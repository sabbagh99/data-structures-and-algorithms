# Graphs
### A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
### It was a good challenge to know how to implement the graph and starting using it with adding nodes or edges
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

## Approach & Efficiency
### What I did is  creating node class to give me ability to add nodes anf edge class to add edges between nodes
### The time complexity is O(n) because the get Neighbors method looping over the edges list;
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API

### In this code challenge we have the following methods :
#### 1. `AddNode()` :  We are using this method to add  a new node to the graph and it's Takes in the value of that node then will return the added node.
#### 2. `AddEdge()` : For adding  a new edge between two nodes in the graph
#### 3. `GetNodes()` : Returns all of the nodes in the graph
#### 4. `GetNeighbors()` : Returns a collection of edges connected to the given node
#### 5. `Size()` : Returns the total number of nodes in the graph
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in your Graph -->
