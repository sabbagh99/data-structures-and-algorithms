# Singly Linked List
### in this code challenge we will use a new definition in data structure which is *Linked List*.

## Challenge
### We need to create linked list by define a class for the node and class for the linked list
## Approach & Efficiency
#### 1. create class for the first *Node* and add a dynamic value for it.
#### 2. create class for Linked list to link each new *Node* with the author *Nodes*.
#### 3. Define methods to insert values in the *Node* and includes method take a value as an argument to find if this value exist in the linked list.
#### 4. Display the output as a string in a specific format.
#### 5. In the end we created a *Test* to check our code if running correctly in all cases.

## API
### We have three method which is :
* #### Insert method  it's take a integer  add to the head if it equals null or to next node if not null.
* #### includes method this method take a integer and check if it exists in the linked list or not.
* #### toString this method adding a string massage showing each node in the linked list.
