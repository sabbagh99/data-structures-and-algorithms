# Linked List.
## in this code challenge we will use a new definition in data structure which is *Linked List*.
### What we did in this challenge?
#### 1. create class for the first *Node* and add a dynamic value for it.
#### 2. create class for Linked list to link each new *Node* with the author *Nodes*.
#### 3. Define methods to insert values in the *Node* and includes method take a value as an argument to find if this value exist in the linked list.
#### 4. Display the output as a string in a specific format.
#### 5. In the end we created a *Test* to check our code if running correctly in all cases.
