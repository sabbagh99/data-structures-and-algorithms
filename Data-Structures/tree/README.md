# Trees

### Trees is a type of data structure and  we have many types of tree in this code challenge we are dealing with binary tree.

## Challenge

### In this challenge what is required is learn how we can traversal in a tree and adding elements.

## Approach & Efficiency

### In this  code challenge most method using recursion the Big(O) for the time is O(log n).

## API

### Here is description for each method in this code challenge :

* #### `preOrder:` to traversal in the tree by following this approach *root >> left >> right*
* #### `inOrder:`to traversal in the tree by following this approach *left >> root >> right*
* #### `postOrder:`to traversal in the tree by following this approach *left >> right >> root*
* #### `add:` this method to add take integer as  input and add it in the correct location in the tree
* #### `contain:` for checking if the provided value exist in the tree or not.
